<p><a href="http://wirfs-brock.com">Rebecca Wirfs-Brock</a> is one of those people who did DDD long before it was called that. She kindly agreed to be interviewed by <a href="http://dddcommunity.org/about-ddd/">Vladimir Gitlevich</a> on behalf of dddcommunity.org. In this interview, Rebecca talks about DDD in relation with responsibility-driven design and OO modeling, integration of DDD with technical frameworks such as Hibernate. She also gives advice on telling<br />
design stories and explaining domain models.</p>
