<p><a href="http://dannorth.net">Dan North</a> and <a href="http://sirenian.livejournal.com">Liz Keogh</a>, the people behind <a href="http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd">Behavior-Driven Development</a>, spoke about how BDD complements DDD with Vladimir Gitlevich at OOPSLA 2007.</p>

<p>Dan North: "<em>...only Domain-Driven Design can tell me where I should or shouldn't be focusing my efforts... once I determined that some computer system might help me, I need a way of getting ... from concept to cash, from an idea of some outcome I want to a production software system making or saving me money. The way in which I get to that is Behavior-Driven Development, it's the series of conversations, interactions, ways in which I express my domain desires as functioning software... </em>"</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>How do you define Behavior-Driven Development?</li>
<li>How does BDD relate to DDD?</li>
<li>Sometimes I write tests to discover the language I need to express a story, and in this case, I call them "scenarios". Then I even spell out TDD as "Test-Driven <em>Design</em>". I noticed that in BDD you use the word "scenario" as well. Do we use it in the same way?</li>
<li>Eric Evans always emphasizes "the power of concrete example": take a story, break it down into concrete scenarios <em>with numbers</em> and talk through these scenarios to understand the story. You have written a tool called <a href="http://jbehave.org">JBehave</a> which formalizes this approach in the language of <em>givens, actions </em>and <em>outcomes</em>. Could you talk about your ideas behind JBehave?</li>
<li>You designed a language around stories and scenarios, the triangle of <em>given, when </em>and <em>then</em>, where stakeholders, domain experts, testers and developers are responsible for some of its vertices. How do you see their responsibilities and interactions?</li>
<li>Let's go back to what you said about BDD being an exercise to remove the word "test". So you removed "test" and replaced it with "should". What difference did it make?</li>
<li>In the beginning of our conversation you said that BDD and DDD are massively complementary. How do they complement each other?</li>
