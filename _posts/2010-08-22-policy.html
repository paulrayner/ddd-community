<h5>This is a non-commercial site, but commercial events are an important part of the community's activity. Therefore, we have established the following guidelines to decide what events we will announce:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Must be primarily for education about DDD or discussion of it.</li>
<li>Must be scheduled and open to the public. (In other words, services being offered privately to clients do not qualify.)</li>
<li>Many such events are free, but a fee may be charged, as with a conference presentation or an open enrollment class.</li>
</ul>
