<div class="D_boxsection">
<p><a href="http://gojko.net">Gojko Adzic</a><br />
has been kind enough to volunteer to present a talk entitled "DDD and<br />
relational databases: the value object dilemma"</p>
<p>Value objects<br />
are one of the corner-stones of domain-driven design but teams often<br />
struggle to use this pattern efficiently when they need to be stored to<br />
relational databases. </p>
<p>In this presentation, Gojko will explore<br />
several approaches to persisting value objects, presents best practices<br />
and talks about common pitfalls for value object persistence.</p>
<p>The meetup will take place on Monday, September 28 at 6:30 p.m. </p>
