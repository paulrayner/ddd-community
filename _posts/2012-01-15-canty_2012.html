<div>January 2012</div>
<div>[<a href="http://dddcommunity.org/wp-content/uploads/files/pdf_articles/Tony_Canty_Labatt_Food_2012.pdf">Read<img alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf.gif" /></a>]</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<strong>Abstract</strong></span></div>
<div>Texas-based <a href="http://www.labattfood.com">Labatt Food Services</a> (10th largest food distribution service in the US at $1 billion sales) had a problem. Every fall, hundreds of schools would start to stock their cafeterias, making large, unpredictable orders and causing chaos in Labatt’s inventories.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><a href="http://www.labattfood.com" target="_blank"><img class="alignright" style="width: 360px; margin: 20px;" alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/labattfood.jpg" width="360" height="222" align="right" /></a>Efficient inventory management is particularly important when perishable food items are involved.  The school startup software, developed at Labatt using a DDD process, was the catalyst to over $1 million dollar operational savings in its first year of existence. In its first 3 years of use, the system has reduced inventory investment by over $8 million dollars while reducing out-of-stock items on orders by 50%, despite a 15% increase in sales.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Furthermore, this application and a tightly aligned new business process were iteratively developed in parallel and rolled out smoothly <em>during the critical period preceding school start</em>!</div>
<div>This deceptively simple application provided big value because it was precisely focused on the core domain, and because the model captured the nuances of the problem, with a good sense of what people do well and where software helps. Coordination of business process rollout and software development allowed just-in-time software that mitigated a serious business risk.</div>
