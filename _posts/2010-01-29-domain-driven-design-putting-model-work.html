<p>
Effective software teams take a torrent of information and knowledge<br />
about their subject matter (the domain) and distill it into a stream of<br />
quality software. Finding and exploiting domain models is a key to<br />
success in projects with complex domains. </p>
<p>Aimed at senior developers, architects and managers, this talk will<br />
outline the foundations of domain-driven design: How models are chosen<br />
and evaluated; How multiple models coexist; How the patterns help avoid<br />
the common pitfalls, such as overly interconnected models; How<br />
developers and domain experts together in a DDD team engage in deeper<br />
exploration of their problem domain and make that understanding<br />
tangible as a practical software design.</p>
<p>This talk will be in English.</p>
<p>Eric will be in Paris from the 15th of Feb teaching his acclaimed <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/course/design-architecture/domain-model/ps-540"><strong>"Eric Evans Domain Driven Design Hands-On Immersion"</strong></a> course.</p>
