<p><img style="width: 173px; height: 105px; margin: 8px;" alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/DDDx2010_lively_discussion_photo_SkillsMatter.jpg" align="left" />The second annual <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/design-architecture/ddd-exchange-2010">DDD eXchange</a> in London is done. Wow! It turned out even better than last year.</p>
<p>The idea had been to make this a real conference, where experts convened to confer on the issues and questions of the moment in DDD. And that is what happened! </p>
<p>Rather than cram the day with talks which, while potentially informative, put attendees in a passive position, the conference focused on two broad themes: Architectural Innovation (especially Event Sourcing and CQRS) and Process Integration (combining DDD with Agile, TDD, BDD, etc.). It also included a lot of opportunities for interaction between everyone present. The whole was greater than the sum of the parts.</p>
<p>In 2010 the community's attention is turned toward two areas of innovative energy: A family of architectural approaches that promise to scale DDD more effectively and more clearly mark context boundaries; and a new look at fitting DDD and Agile processes together along with a handful of other key best practices.</p>
<p>The conference featured 7 expert talks, including those by Eric Evans, Udi Dahan and Greg Young, and two Parkbench sessions. All the talks were recorded and you can <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/design-architecture/ddd-exchange-2010">watch them online</a>. </p>
<p>Eric Evans wrote up his impressions of the conference in the Domain Language newsletter <a href="http://domainlanguage.com/newsletter">here</a>.</p>
