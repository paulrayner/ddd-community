    <strong>Abstract</strong>:
<p>In the 5 years since the book was published, I've practiced DDD on<br />
various client projects, and I've continued to learn about what works,<br />
what doesn't work, and how to conceptualize and describe it all. Also,<br />
I've gained perspective and learned a great deal from the increasing<br />
number of expert practitioners of DDD who have emerged.</p>
<p>The fundamentals have held up well, as well as most patterns, but there<br />
are differences in how I do things and look at things now. I will try to<br />
describe them, very informally, in this talk.</p>
<p>Over this time, I have folded in a couple of additional patterns, and<br />
essentially come to ignore a few, but the biggest change has been a<br />
subtle shift of emphasis. Ubiquitous Language and Context Mapping and<br />
Core Domain are at the center, with aggregates in close orbit. Why, I<br />
ask myself, did I put context mapping in Chapter 14? Core domain in<br />
Chapter 15?! Before the book, it seemed self-evident to me that SOA fit<br />
well with DDD, but five years of questions on that topic have made it<br />
clear that my early explanations were inadequate and helped me clarify<br />
how it fits. Increased emphasis on events and distributed processing<br />
have crystallized the significance of aggregates and refined the<br />
building blocks.</p>
<p>The talk cannot go into depth on all these topics, but the goal will be<br />
to give a quick look at where my view of DDD has been heading.</p>
