<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p><img style="float: left; margin: 3px;" alt="Vladimir Gitlevich" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Vlad_JavaZone.jpg" width="133" height="200" />We tend to think of the identity of objects as a simple, even technical thing, but the identity of domain entities are an important part of a model, and in a complex domain they can be subtle concepts in their own right. This report is based on a true story of such a discovery (names changed to protect the innocent). It shows how discovery and naming of just one such missing concept helped developers of a large banking application to shift their focus from the "how" of the infrastructure to the "what" and "why" of the domain, allowing them to understand the domain more deeply and communicate more clearly.</p>
