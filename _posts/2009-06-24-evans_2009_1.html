<p>In this talk, first presented at<a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/presentation/What+I%27ve+learned+about+DDD+since+the+book"> QCon London 2009</a>, Eric Evans describes what he'd learned about DDD since the book was published. The talk was recorded at the May meeting of <a href="http://dddnyc.org">DDD-NYC SIG</a>.</p>
<p>Because the talk goes over what has <em>changed</em> since the book, it assumes some knowledge of DDD. If you need a quick refresher, please <a href="http://dddcommunity.org/library/evans_2009_2">watch the introduction part</a> first.</p>
<p>Here is the summary from QCon site:</p>
<p>"<em>In the 5 years since the book was published, I've practiced DDD on<br />
various client projects, and I've continued to learn about what works,<br />
what doesn't work, and how to conceptualize and describe it all. Also,<br />
I've gained perspective and learned a great deal from the increasing<br />
number of expert practitioners of DDD who have emerged.</em></p>
<p><em>The fundamentals have held up well, as well as most patterns, but there<br />
are differences in how I do things and look at things now. I will try to<br />
describe them, very informally, in this talk.</em></p>
<p><em>Over this time, I have folded in a couple of additional patterns, and<br />
essentially come to ignore a few, but the biggest change has been a<br />
subtle shift of emphasis. Ubiquitous Language and Context Mapping and<br />
Core Domain are at the center, with aggregates in close orbit. Why, I<br />
ask myself, did I put context mapping in Chapter 14? Core domain in<br />
Chapter 15?! Before the book, it seemed self-evident to me that SOA fit<br />
well with DDD, but five years of questions on that topic have made it<br />
clear that my early explanations were inadequate and helped me clarify<br />
how it fits. Increased emphasis on events and distributed processing<br />
have crystallized the significance of aggregates and refined the<br />
building blocks.</em></p>
<p><em>The talk cannot go into depth on all these topics, but the goal will be<br />
to give a quick look at where my view of DDD has been heading.</em>"</p>
